## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Voice Session Management
- **POST** `/api/voice/session` - Start voice session with specific agent
- **GET** `/api/voice/sessions/:id` - Get voice session status
- **DELETE** `/api/voice/sessions/:id` - End voice session
- **GET** `/api/voice/sessions` - List active sessions (admin only)

### 2. Agent Voice Configuration
- **GET** `/api/voice/agents/:id/config` - Get agent voice configuration
- Integrates with existing agent JSON files
- Supports voice settings (stability, similarity boost, style)
- Includes personality traits for voice interaction

### 3. WebRTC Support
- **POST** `/api/voice/offer` - Handle WebRTC offer/answer exchange
- **POST** `/api/voice/ice` - Handle ICE candidates
- Session-based WebRTC state management
- Real-time signaling via WebSocket

### 4. Voice Transcription
- **POST** `/api/voice/transcribe` - Handle voice transcription
- Placeholder for STT integration (Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text)
- Agent response generation
- Language detection support

### 5. Real-time Communication
- WebSocket events for voice sessions
- Real-time WebRTC signaling
- Session room management
- Broadcast capabilities for multi-participant sessions

### 6. Security & Authentication
- Optional authentication on all endpoints
- Session access control
- Admin-only endpoints for session management
- User-specific session isolation

## Agent Integration

The voice system fully integrates with existing agent configurations:

### Supported Agents
All agents with `voice_config.enabled: true` in their JSON files:
- `dr_pedro` - Voice ID: pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB
- `carlos_en` - Voice ID: nPczCjzI2devNBz1zQrb  
- `sophia_knight` - Voice ID: jsCqWAovK2LkecY7zXl4
- And other agents with voice configurations

### Voice Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "voice_config": {
    "enabled": true,
    "voice_id": "unique_voice_id",
    "voice_name": "Agent Name",
    "settings": {
      "stability": 0.7,
      "similarityBoost": 0.8,
      "style": 0.5,
      "useSpeakerBoost": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Start a Voice Session
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/voice/session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId": "dr_pedro"}'
```

### Get Agent Voice Config
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/api/voice/agents/dr_pedro/config
```

### WebRTC Offer Exchange
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/voice/offer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId": "voice_123...", "type": "offer", "offer": {...}}'
```

## Testing

Run the voice API tests:
```bash
npm run test:voice
```

This will test all endpoints and verify proper error handling.

## Next Steps for Full Integration

### 1. Speech-to-Text Integration
- Replace transcription placeholder with actual STT service
- Integrate with Whisper API or Google Speech-to-Text
- Add language detection and multi-language support

### 2. Text-to-Speech Integration  
- Implement TTS with agent voice settings
- Use voice_id from agent configuration
- Apply stability, similarity boost, and style settings

### 3. WebRTC Server Implementation
- Add actual WebRTC media server (e.g., Kurento, Janus)
- Implement SDP processing for real offers/answers
- Add STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal

### 4. Database Integration
- Move session storage from memory to database/Redis
- Add session persistence and recovery
- Implement session analytics and logging

### 5. Voice Activity Detection
- Add VAD for better conversation flow
- Implement silence detection
- Add interrupt handling for natural conversations

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Modular Design** - Voice functionality is separate but integrated
2. **Agent Agnostic** - Works with any agent that has voice configuration
3. **Scalable** - Session management supports multiple concurrent sessions
4. **Extensible** - Easy to add new voice features and integrations
5. **Secure** - Proper authentication and access control
6. **Real-time** - WebSocket support for low-latency communication

## Performance Considerations

- Session cleanup every 5 minutes prevents memory leaks
- 30-minute session timeout for inactive sessions
- In-memory session storage for development (upgrade to Redis for production)
- Efficient WebSocket room management
- Proper error handling and graceful degradation

The voice implementation is now ready for Pedro's WebRTC integration and other voice systems, providing a robust foundation for voice-enabled conversational agents.
